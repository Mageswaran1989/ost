\chapter{Introduction}
The whole universe is seen in the form of a person. The body of the universe consists of the 12 Rashis, which can be roughly translated as “astrological signs.” Each Rashi represents a part of the body. The nine Grahas or planets govern this universal body. The 12 Rashis are represented in the Maharishi Jyotish program as 12 equal segments of a circle, each covering 30 degrees.The sequence of the 12 Rashis begins with Mesha as the first Rashi.

\end{figure}

This illustration shows the sequence of the 27 equal segments of the Nakshatras, each consisting of 13 degrees 20 minutes, with their Sanskrit names and numbers. As seen from the earth, the moon passes through this circle of the 27 Nakshatras in about 27 days. Thus it takes the moon about one day to pass through one Nakshatra. The moon is shown here moving through Pushya Nakshatra in Karka Rashi. This example also shows the sun moving through Ashvini Nakshatra in Mesha Rashi. Each of the other planets are also moving through the 27 Nakshatras.
Nakshatra Pada: Each Nakshatra is divided into 4 equal parts of 3 degrees 20 minutes each part. They are called Nakshatra Pada 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each Nakshatra Pada has its own significance for interpretation.
